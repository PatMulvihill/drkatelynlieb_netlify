Dr. Katelyn Lieb is a licensed naturopathic physician in the state of Connecticut. She received a Bachelor of Science from Syracuse University where she majored in Nutrition Science, minored in Food Studies, and completed a pre-med track. She went on to receive a Doctorate of Naturopathic Medicine and a Master of Science in Nutrition from University of Bridgeport. During her time at University of Bridgeport she served as the President of the local Naturopathic Medical Student Association chapter and trained as a Pathfinder Scholar under Dr. Peter D’Adamo, author of Eat Right for Your Type.

Dr. Lieb’s personal struggles with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and her passion for combining medicine and nutrition inspired her to become a naturopathic doctor. She believes that the key to helping patients achieve optimal health is educating them on how to better understand their health conditions and empowering them with the tools needed to be an active part of their own healing. Her goal with each patient is to investigate, discover, and treat the root cause of their condition. Dr. Lieb’s style of treatment prioritizes using food as medicine, nutritional counseling and supplementation, lifestyle modifications, the mind-body connection, and botanical medicine, along with functional medical testing.

Her practice focus includes:
* Thyroid conditions
* Women’s health conditions (such as hormonal imbalances, endometriosis, PCOS)
* Gastrointestinal conditions
* Adrenal health
* Stress & anxiety management
* Autoimmune conditions
* Headaches & muscle tension
* High blood pressure
* High cholesterol
* Diabetes
* Allergies
* Asthma
* Sleep disorders

In her free time, she loves practicing yoga, cooking, snowboarding, and spending time outdoors.
